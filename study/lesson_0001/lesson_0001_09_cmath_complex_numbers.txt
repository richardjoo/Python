let's do sqrt(-1 and see what happens

>>> from math import sqrt
>>> sqrt(-1)
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ValueError: math domain error

so, if you use regular math library, and trying to do some complex math problems, then you would get an error like this.
so, how to solve this?

You will need to import the complex math library.


>>> import cmath
>>> cmath.sqrt(-1)
1j


and you can also do other things like
>>> (2 + 4j) * (12 + 2j)
(16+52j)
>>>
