now, it is time to create a code and run it with python, instead of writing the code at the command lines :-)
create a code (I already did)...

lesson_0001_010.py 

that will ask you a name and display your name.

you would run this like

python lesson_0001.010.py

enjoy!  :-)



here is what I excuted:

new-host:lesson_0001 richardjoo$ python lesson_0001_10.py 
What is your name? Richard
Welcome to python, Richard!!!  :-D
new-host:lesson_0001 richardjoo$
