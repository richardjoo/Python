Every language has comments....
@_@

Python = use #


like this

# this is a comment
# another line of comment
#
# I just put empty space after the comment above. and this is also a comment, by the way.
# did you notice this is a comment too??
# print "this is a comment"   IS a comment
print "this is NOT a comment"
# the line above is NOT a comment because I did not put # there.

Why do I need to make a big deal about the comments?
I dunno~  :-\
