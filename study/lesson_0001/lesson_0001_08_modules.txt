you use the modules by using "import"

>>> import math
>>> math.floor(99.9)
99.0
>>> 


you can also use to bring more specific function
and if you use this way, you don't have to use module prefix.  

>>> from math import floor
>>> floor(123.42)
123.0
>>> 



You can even use variable to refer to the function.
>>> surprise = math.floor
>>> surprise(423.42)
423.0
>>>
