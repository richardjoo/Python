This is my Python study section.
More than welcome to use whatever it is in here.
I have three branches.  master - qa - dev

don't know why I did this, (my bad habbit of creating three)...  
codes are all under dev for now.  So, please go there and check the codes.

I use wiki often.  so, you can check the wiki section as well.
Thanks~
